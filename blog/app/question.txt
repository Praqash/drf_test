Create a simple Blog API using Django REST framework. The API should have the following features:

User Authentication:

Use Token Authentication for securing your API.
Allow users to register and obtain an authentication token.
Blog Post Model:

Create a model for Blog Posts with the following fields:
Title (CharField)
Content (TextField)
Author (ForeignKey to User)
Created_at (DateTimeField - automatically set on creation)
Ensure that only authenticated users can create, update, or delete blog posts.
API Endpoints:

Implement the following API endpoints:
List all blog posts (GET /api/posts/)
Retrieve a single blog post by its ID (GET /api/posts/<id>/)
Create a new blog post (POST /api/posts/)
Update a blog post by its ID (PUT /api/posts/<id>/)
Delete a blog post by its ID (DELETE /api/posts/<id>/)
User Profile:

Create an endpoint to retrieve the profile information of the authenticated user (GET /api/profile/).
Bonus:

Implement pagination for listing blog posts.
Add tags to blog posts, and allow filtering posts by tags.
Ensure proper validation, error handling, and documentation in your code.
